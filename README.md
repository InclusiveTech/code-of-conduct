# Uk Inclusive Tech - Code of Conduct

![alt text](https://github.com/InclusiveTech/code-of-conduct/raw/master/logo.png "Inclusive Tech Community Logo")

## Welcome

We are a group of engineers, geeks, designers, nerds, tinkerers, thinkers, speakers, philosophers, and most importantly people, within Twitter UK who are passionate about technology and the amazing power of community that comes with it.

We like to organise, host and collaborate on events here at Twitter UK and if you’re reading this then you’ve probably signed up or been invited along to the office. While you’re here we have a few suggestions that we think make for great experience.

## Principles

###Inclusivity 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧🧛‍👨‍👨‍👦🏃‍♀️👨‍👩‍👧‍👧🧘‍♀️🐙👩‍⚕️

We respect and welcome everyone who hosts, speaks, attends and contributes to our events. We are all here to learn, share and enjoy our time together. We give all opinions a fair opportunity to be heard.

### How we interact 🤙

We encourage open discussion and diverse opinions. Ideas, talks and questions should be respectful and constructive, everyone should feel safe. Creating and maintaining a safe space is everyone's responsibility.

### Why we interact like this 🙌

We are considerate and respectful in our speech and actions. Compassion and empathy is the basis for all human interaction.

### Attitude 💁‍♂️💁‍♀️

We aim to support each other, and this should guide all of our discussions.  We always assume the best intentions from everyone - we assume that everyone is acting to the best of their abilities given the knowledge they have.

### Enforcement ⚖️

Behaviour that falls outside of the above guiding principles will not be tolerated. To err is human. If we make a mistake, we should be willing to repair any harm caused by it.

### The Golden Rule 🥇

These are our guiding principles. It's hard to anticipate all potential issues. Respect, compassion, and empathy will be used as guidance in any cases of ambiguity, or where any particular rule may seem vague or incorrect.

### If you’re stuck?

If you don’t feel comfortable or notice something happening to someone else that you want to raise, either approach one of the organisers in person or contact us via the following methods below:
